#Step by Step Instruction:

1. Attempt to connect the Wii Remote and the Wii Balance Board to the PC with Bluetooth Connection
	a. Windows 10+ will require a pin code for connection, which we don't have
	b. A workaround is to go to "Devices and Printers"/ "Ger√§te und Drucker" and add a new device in that context window
	c. Press the sync button on one Wii device and wait until the device is depicted as an option.
	d. Quickly add the device and if you are promted to type in a pin-code, ignore it and press "Next"
	e. Wait until the device has been installed onto the PC
	f. If it didn't work try again, if it still does not work, then the PC is not compatible with the Wii Devices
	g. Do the same with the other Wii device from 1.b

2. Turn on Wii Remotes in the Dolphin Emulator
	a. Open "Dolphin Emulator"
	b. Go to "Controllers"
	c. On "Wii Remotes" press "Emulate the Wii's Bluetooth adapter" and turn Wii Remote 1 & 2 to "Real Wii Remote"
	d. Toggle "Real Balance Board" to true
	e. Toggle "Continuous Scanning" to true
	f. Press and hold the 1 and  2 button until the Remote vibrates and its LEDs are on
	g. Press the "Sync Button" on the Wii Balance Board, until the LED in the front is on

3. Run the game
	a. Make sure the "Builds.zip" is downloaded, unpacked and ready to start playing
	b. If both of the Wii Devices is on, start the game
	c. Leave the Wii Remote on a flat surface until the text on the bottom left says that "Motion Plus is ready"
	d. If the text on the bottom left says that "Balance Board is ready" you are ready to go.
	e. If the Balance Board is not detected a text will display instead, if it happens restart the game.
	f. You can now play the game
	g. If the Motion Plus behaves weirdly, restart the game and start from 3b.
